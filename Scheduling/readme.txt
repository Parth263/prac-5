I'll help you understand CPU scheduling from concepts to code implementation and how to run it in VSCode.

CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING:
CPU scheduling is a fundamental operating system concept that determines which process gets the CPU for execution. The main goals are:
1. Maximize CPU utilization
2. Minimize waiting time
3. Ensure fair allocation of CPU

The code implements 4 major scheduling algorithms:

1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
   - Simplest scheduling algorithm
   - Non-preemptive
   - Processes are executed in order of arrival
   - Easy to implement but can lead to "convoy effect"

2. Shortest Job First (SJF) Preemptive
   - Also known as Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)
   - Preempts current process if a new process arrives with shorter burst time
   - Optimal in terms of average waiting time
   - Difficult to predict burst time in practice

3. Priority Scheduling (Non-preemptive)
   - Each process has a priority
   - Higher priority processes are executed first
   - Can lead to starvation of lower priority processes
   - Simple but needs aging mechanism to prevent starvation

4. Round Robin
   - Time quantum based
   - Preemptive
   - Fair allocation of CPU
   - Good for time-sharing systems
   - Higher average waiting time but better response time

CODE EXPLANATION:

1. Process Class Structure:
```java
class Process {
    int id;              // Process identifier
    int arrivalTime;     // When process arrives
    int burstTime;       // Total CPU time needed
    int remainingTime;   // Remaining execution time
    int priority;        // Priority level
    int waitingTime;     // Time spent waiting
    int turnaroundTime;  // Total time in system
    int completionTime;  // When process completes
}
```

2. Main Components:
- Input handling for process details
- Menu-driven interface for algorithm selection
- Implementation of each scheduling algorithm
- Result calculation and display

3. Key Performance Metrics:
- Waiting Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time - Burst Time
- Turnaround Time = Completion Time - Arrival Time
- Average Waiting Time and Average Turnaround Time

RUNNING IN VSCODE:

1. Setup:
   - Install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
   - Install Java Extension Pack
   - Install JDK if not already installed

2. Steps to Run:
   ```
   1. Open VSCode
   2. Create new file "Scheduling.java"
   3. Paste the code
   4. Save the file
   5. Open terminal in VSCode (View -> Terminal)
   6. Compile: javac Scheduling.java
   7. Run: java Scheduling
   ```

3. Sample Input:
```
Enter number of processes: 3
Process 1: 0 5 2 (arrival time, burst time, priority)
Process 2: 1 3 1
Process 3: 2 4 3
Choose algorithm (1-4)
```

I'll break down the CPU scheduling concepts in more detail with code examples.

1. FIRST COME FIRST SERVE (FCFS)
---------------------------------
Think of it like a queue at a bank - first person to arrive gets served first.

Concept:
- Simplest scheduling algorithm
- Non-preemptive (once a process starts, it runs to completion)
- Processes run in order of arrival
- Like standing in line - first come, first served

Example Scenario:
```
Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time
P1            0             5
P2            1             3
P3            2             4
```

Here's the FCFS implementation:
```java
public static void FCFS(Process[] processes) {
    // Sort by arrival time
    Arrays.sort(processes, Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.arrivalTime));
    
    int currentTime = 0;  // Current time tracker
    
    for (Process p : processes) {
        // If CPU is idle, move time to when next process arrives
        if (currentTime < p.arrivalTime) {
            currentTime = p.arrivalTime;
        }
        
        // Calculate waiting time
        p.waitingTime = currentTime - p.arrivalTime;
        
        // Execute process (add burst time to current time)
        currentTime += p.burstTime;
        
        // Calculate turnaround time
        p.turnaroundTime = p.waitingTime + p.burstTime;
        p.completionTime = currentTime;
    }
}
```

2. SHORTEST JOB FIRST (SJF) - Preemptive
----------------------------------------
Think of it like a smart todo list where you always pick the quickest task, even if it means pausing your current task.

Concept:
- Chooses process with shortest remaining time
- Preemptive (can interrupt running process)
- Optimal for minimizing average waiting time
- Like constantly reorganizing your todo list based on shortest remaining tasks

Example:
```
Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time
P1            0             6
P2            2             4
P3            4             2
```

Implementation:
```java
public static void SJFPreemptive(Process[] processes) {
    int currentTime = 0;
    int completed = 0;
    
    // Sort by arrival time
    Arrays.sort(processes, Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.arrivalTime));
    
    // Priority queue to get shortest remaining time process
    PriorityQueue<Process> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
        Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.remainingTime)
    );

    while (completed < processes.length) {
        // Add newly arrived processes to queue
        for (Process p : processes) {
            if (p.arrivalTime <= currentTime && p.remainingTime > 0 
                && !pq.contains(p)) {
                pq.add(p);
            }
        }

        if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Process current = pq.poll();  // Get shortest job
            current.remainingTime--;      // Execute for 1 time unit
            currentTime++;

            // If process completes
            if (current.remainingTime == 0) {
                completed++;
                current.completionTime = currentTime;
                current.turnaroundTime = currentTime - current.arrivalTime;
                current.waitingTime = current.turnaroundTime - current.burstTime;
            } else {
                pq.add(current);  // Add back to queue if not complete
            }
        } else {
            currentTime++;  // CPU idle
        }
    }
}
```

3. PRIORITY SCHEDULING (Non-preemptive)
--------------------------------------
Think of it like emergency room triage - patients with more critical conditions (higher priority) get treated first.

Concept:
- Each process has a priority number
- Lower number usually means higher priority
- Non-preemptive (runs to completion once started)
- Can lead to starvation of low priority processes

Example:
```
Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time   Priority
P1            0             4            2
P2            1             3            1    // Highest priority
P3            2             2            3
```

Implementation:
```java
public static void PriorityNonPreemptive(Process[] processes) {
    int currentTime = 0;
    int completed = 0;
    
    // Sort initially by arrival time
    Arrays.sort(processes, Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.arrivalTime));
    
    // Queue sorted by priority
    PriorityQueue<Process> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
        Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.priority)
    );

    while (completed < processes.length) {
        // Add newly arrived processes
        for (Process p : processes) {
            if (p.arrivalTime <= currentTime && p.remainingTime > 0 
                && !pq.contains(p)) {
                pq.add(p);
            }
        }

        if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Process current = pq.poll();  // Get highest priority process
            
            // Calculate waiting time
            current.waitingTime = currentTime - current.arrivalTime;
            
            // Execute entire process
            currentTime += current.burstTime;
            current.completionTime = currentTime;
            current.turnaroundTime = current.waitingTime + current.burstTime;
            current.remainingTime = 0;
            completed++;
        } else {
            currentTime++;  // CPU idle
        }
    }
}
```

4. ROUND ROBIN
-------------
Think of it like a fair carousel ride - everyone gets a fixed time to ride, then moves to the back of the line.

Concept:
- Each process gets a fixed time slice (quantum)
- After quantum expires, process moves to back of queue
- Fair distribution of CPU time
- Good for time-sharing systems

Example:
```
Process   Arrival Time   Burst Time   Time Quantum = 2
P1            0             5
P2            1             3
P3            2             4
```

Implementation:
```java
public static void RoundRobin(Process[] processes, int quantum) {
    int currentTime = 0;
    int completed = 0;
    Queue<Process> queue = new LinkedList<>();  // Ready queue
    
    // Sort by arrival time
    Arrays.sort(processes, Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.arrivalTime));
    
    int i = 0;  // Index for tracking arrival of new processes
    
    while (completed < processes.length) {
        // Add newly arrived processes to queue
        while (i < processes.length && 
               processes[i].arrivalTime <= currentTime) {
            queue.add(processes[i]);
            i++;
        }

        if (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Process current = queue.poll();
            
            // Execute for quantum or remaining time, whichever is less
            int execTime = Math.min(current.remainingTime, quantum);
            current.remainingTime -= execTime;
            currentTime += execTime;

            // Process completed
            if (current.remainingTime == 0) {
                completed++;
                current.completionTime = currentTime;
                current.turnaroundTime = currentTime - current.arrivalTime;
                current.waitingTime = current.turnaroundTime - current.burstTime;
            } else {
                // Add back to queue if not completed
                queue.add(current);
            }
        } else {
            currentTime++;  // CPU idle
        }
    }
}
```

Key Terms:
1. Burst Time: Total CPU time needed by process
2. Arrival Time: When process enters ready queue
3. Waiting Time: Time spent waiting in ready queue
4. Turnaround Time: Total time from arrival to completion
5. Completion Time: When process finishes execution
6. Time Quantum: Fixed time slice in Round Robin

To Execute in VSCode:
1. Create a new Java file:
```bash
# In VSCode terminal
mkdir scheduling
cd scheduling
code Scheduling.java
```

2. Paste the complete code and save

3. Compile and run:
```bash
javac Scheduling.java
java Scheduling
```

4. Input example:
```
Enter number of processes: 3
For Process 1:
Arrival Time: 0
Burst Time: 5
Priority: 2

For Process 2:
Arrival Time: 1
Burst Time: 3
Priority: 1

For Process 3:
Arrival Time: 2
Burst Time: 4
Priority: 3

Choose algorithm (1-4): 1

The program will show results including:
- Completion time for each process
- Waiting time for each process
- Turnaround time for each process
- Average waiting time
- Average turnaround time
```
